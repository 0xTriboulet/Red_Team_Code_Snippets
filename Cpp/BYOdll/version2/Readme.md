Beats BitDefender by unhooking all function calls by reloading ntdll hardcoded into the binary. ntdll is stored as a local variable in main so this program needs a BEEFY stack to manage it. This program suffers from the same limitation of dropping the hardcoded copy of ntdll to disk before loading.
