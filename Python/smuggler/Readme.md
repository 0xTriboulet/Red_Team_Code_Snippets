Short python script that converts any file into a base64 encoded zip file stored in out.txt. You can then copy the script and the contents of out.txt into a a .py and an in.txt file (respectively) on the target environment and run the script again. This methodology allows you to transfer executables into environments that otherwise do not allow file transfers.
